# Banking-App
### **Project: Online Banking System (Java + Swing)**  

**Description:**  
The **Online Banking System** is a simple Java-based GUI application that allows users to register, log in, and view their account balances. Built using **Java Swing**, this project demonstrates basic banking functionalities in a standalone environment without database integration.  

**Features:**  
- **User Registration:** Allows new users to create an account.  
- **User Login:** Existing users can log in using their credentials.  
- **Balance Inquiry:** Displays the user's current account balance after login.  

This project serves as a foundation for expanding into a fully functional banking system with additional features like **deposit, withdrawal, transaction history, and database integration**.  

Would you like me to help you add MySQL integration or more banking features? ðŸš€
